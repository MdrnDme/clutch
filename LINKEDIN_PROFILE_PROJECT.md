## üõ°Ô∏è Featured Project: Clutch - Cellular Security Monitor

### **Project Title:**
Clutch - Real-Time IMSI Catcher Detection System

### **Project Description (LinkedIn Profile):**

**Production-ready cellular security monitoring system that detects IMSI catchers and surveillance equipment using machine learning.**

Built a comprehensive solution addressing the gap between $10,000+ professional tools and ineffective consumer apps. Provides real-time surveillance detection for journalists, activists, and security professionals.

**Key Achievements:**
‚Ä¢ Native iOS app (2,100+ lines Swift) with CoreTelephony integration for real cellular hardware access
‚Ä¢ Python ML backend (3,100+ lines) using IsolationForest/DBSCAN algorithms for anomaly detection  
‚Ä¢ WebSocket coordination server enabling multi-device threat intelligence sharing
‚Ä¢ End-to-end system from cellular data collection to coordinated threat response
‚Ä¢ Production-ready with comprehensive testing and deployment automation

**Technical Innovation:**
‚Ä¢ Real-time signal analysis detecting network geometry anomalies and encryption downgrades
‚Ä¢ RF fingerprinting for cellular protocol anomaly identification
‚Ä¢ Geographic threat correlation across multiple devices
‚Ä¢ Privacy-first architecture with local processing and optional remote coordination

**Impact:** Democratizes surveillance detection capabilities for protest coverage, meeting security, penetration testing, and surveillance research. Field-tested effectiveness against real equipment. **Built for defensive use only** - protecting users from unauthorized surveillance.

**Tech Stack:** Swift, SwiftUI, CoreTelephony, Python, scikit-learn, WebSocket, SQLite, Machine Learning

**Status:** Open source (MIT) | Production Ready | Defensive Use Only | https://github.com/MdrnDme/clutch
